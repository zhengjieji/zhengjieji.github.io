I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Virginia Tech, advised by Prof. Dan Williams. My research focuses on operating systems, with an emphasis on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and verification. Currently, I am working on improving the eBPF verifier via enhancing static validation.
